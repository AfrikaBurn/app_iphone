In 2014, \u201cThe Lost Couple Lose Their Luggage\u201d saw two sets of performances underscored by three Italian virtuoso musicians: \u201cThe Grannies\u201d were a flock of octogenarian matriarchs who blew through the desert cleaning, judging and partaking in the revelry of the Burn, and \u201cThe Businessmen\u201d were a dark troupe who itemized, documented and measured all they encountered. In 2015 the collective created \u201cThe Outer Rim\u201d, a programmable LED Frisbee field on which Burners played competitive night Frisbee, or Disc Ultimate. AfrikaBurn 2016 saw the team ensconced at the \u201cMemnox Menagerie\u201d, a theme camp oriented around the animals and other organisms of the burn. In 2016 \u201cThe Outer Rim\u201d returned to the Burn, and the team also brought \u201cThe Lost Couple Find God\u201d, another masked performance involving ten newly created demi-Gods, which roamed the desert casting divine judgment upon burners.

In our modern world, where the pace of life is so demanding, walking the labyrinth gives an opportunity to return to a different pace, to slow down and settle into a gentle rhythm. Our inner journey determines the outer path we walk through life. Yet frequently we are too busy to attend to that inner quest. Use the labyrinth to engage contemplatively and dynamically with both the inner and the outer path in life. There are 10 \u0026quot;Pauses\u0026quot; along the journey and participants are required to stop and reflect on things like, their earliest memory from childhood, what they are grateful for, what they would die for, what they would give up, where they are headed etc. And at the end of the Labyrinth they write a letter to themselves and seal it in an envelope.

Firstly; to design and curate collaborative-creative spaces whereby the creative impulse may manifest in greater complexity, novelty and synergy. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nAnd secondly; to facilitate the transition of the greater collective to a level of transpersonal consciousness through the synergy of art and technology. This collective identifies the need for a critical mass of people on this planet to undergo a transformation towards a more inclusive identity and worldview if the human species is to survive the transition that is now underway. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nOur 2018 project introduces our new collective and a fresh perspective to art and music curation at Afrikaburn. Arkology 2018 is principally a music venue designed for showcasing live-electronic music acts with a large emphasis on curated performances and dynamically synchronised visual effects \u0026amp; lighting. In essence, the stage is an evolving exploration of the fusion of art and technology, and how both elements may achieve synergy at the intersection of the human mind. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nAs designers we view the stage as a kind of complex system (exhibiting characteristics such as emergent behaviour and self-organisation). With complexity in mind, we allow the space to emerge organically through the synergistic interactions of its subsystems, so that what emerges is a kind of \u2018living system\u2019 at the nexus of art and technology. At this nexus we find the human-being, the conscious agent through which everything appears and is experienced, and who is at the same time an active co-creator of the space. Our design perspective therefore recognises complexity but resists the tendency to reduce sentience (or \u2018human interiority\u2019) to a purely systems-perspective. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nIn this sense we recognise that truly successful creative spaces actually facilitate the emergence of greater creative unfoldment through positive-feedback loops between individuals and the space itself. The space being the womb that nurtures the creative impulse of the individual and\/or collective while facilitating the alignment of agents so that all are co-creating in harmony.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nUltimately, this suggests a more fundamental reason for designing and curating creative spaces that goes beyond simply building a kind of hedonistic enterprise that encourages passive \u0026#039;consumption\u0026#039; by the audience. Instead, this perspective suggests that the Universe recognises (through the individual body-mind and the collective interior) that it is in fact co-creating with itself. As designers, then, the question is well, \u0026#039;how do we generate spaces that facilitate this recognition?\u0026#039;.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nOur 2018 stage will mark the beginning of this exploration, emerging in the blank canvas of the desert as a space to co-create with one-another at this extraordinary juncture in the evolution of our planet. Our hope is that Arkology 2018 symbolizes for many that which cannot be articulated in words.
