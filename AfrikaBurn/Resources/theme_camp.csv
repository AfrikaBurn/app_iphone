He is built on a 3 wheeler trike base, with a passenger and wing operator sitting behind the driver. The dragons head and mane has been carefully put together by welding sheets of steel and then given a rustic finish. The eyes will light up with LED lights. We hope to be able to put a mechanism to blow fire out the nostrils as the flames need to be vertical for safety reasons. We will be adding to light weight psychedelic material wings that will be manually operated to flap up and down.

Circles of life, born from pulses of light. Vibrate to breathe, while spiralling outwards for infinity through the lens of time and into a sea of stars and lucid dreams. We go in circles every day. Within a sphere of self-created constraints, we spin round and round. Yet, none of us have forgotten how to play. Every year there's one week where we create a place to meet new circles of trust, comfort, and love by letting go of the circles we know. Our theme camp will be the embodiment of these new circles. In search of a journey that will intertwine old and new circles, we hope to bring play to Afrika Burn. We will provide some dazzling drawing machines, that will allow people to create their new reality. Resulting in mesmerizing artworks, intimate parties and random acts of craziness. We will offer small day or evening DJ sessions with ethno-techno, disco and lounge, fitting the growing artwork that our camp will become. Some live musicians will bring sing and play to set an atmosphere to relax and enjoy the art every now and then. And of course our yoga sessions in the dome, as well as the much celebrated Poffertjes will be back to draw the many to the camp. Check our blackboard for daily activities.

"6231","Theme Camp Form 3 - WTF Guide 6231","","Adult, Care and Support, Family Friendly, Food / Drink, For the Kids, Game / Sport, Musical Collaberation, Party / Gathering, Ritual / Ceremony, Workshop / Class","Many years ago there was a theme camp so exceedingly fond of fun and games that they spent all their energy on being the best decorated and best dressed theme camp on the Binnekring. They had an activity and outfit for every hour of the day, and instead of going out in the evenings, they hosted the most splendid parties.

In the great town where they lived, life was always gay. Every day many strangers came to town, and among them one day came two tricksters. They let it be known they were theme camp planners and veteran burners, and they said they could plan the most magnificent activities and parties imaginable. Not only were their games and decorations uncommonly fun and amazingly fine, but camps made of these wonders had a wonderful way of becoming invisible to anyone who was unfit for Tankwa Town, or who was unusually stupid.

""This would be just fabulous,"" thought the camp leads. ""We could finally get rid of the riffraff and host only the most exclusive and entertaining guests. Yes, we have to get these fantastic chaps to plan our camp for the year of 'Play'."" 

They set up spreadsheets and tasklists and pretended to plan, sending out invoices and invites to everyone in the world. They ticked boxes, and made forms, and drew diagrams and dug deep into the pockets of the theme camp leads. Planning and plotting way into the night. 

""I'd like to know how those planners are getting on with the camp,"" the camp leads thought, but they felt slightly uncomfortable when they remembered that those who were unfit for Tankwa Town would not be able to see the results, and 'just wouldn't get it'. It couldn't have been that they doubted themselves, yet they thought they'd rather send someone else to see how things were going. The whole of Tankwa Town knew about the camp's peculiar powers, and all were impatient to find out how stupid their neighbors were.

""We'll send our honest old wrangler and longest camp member to the planners,"" the camp leads decided. ""She'll be the best one to tell us how the decorations look and the activities sound, for she's a sensible woman and no one knows a better playlist or a sweeter smoothy than her. She really 'gets' Tankwa Town""

So the honest old wrangler went to the place where the two tricksters sat working away at their empty spreadsheets and meaningless timetables.

""Heaven help me,"" she thought as her eyes flew wide open, ""I can't see anything at all"". But she did not say so.

Both the tricksters begged her to be so kind as to come near to approve the excellent guestlist, the awesome layout, and the beautiful silken tents. They pointed to the empty sheets and invisible Bedouins , and the poor old wrangler stared as hard as she dared. She couldn't see anything, because there was nothing to see. ""Heaven have mercy,"" she thought. ""Can it be that I'm a fool? I'd have never guessed it, and not a soul must know. Am I unfit to be a camp wrangler? Am I not suitable for Tankwa Town? It would never do to let on that I can't see the preparations.""

""Don't hesitate to tell us what you think of it,"" said one of the tricksters.

""Oh, it's beautiful -it's enchanting."" The veteran camp wrangler peered through her spectacles. ""Such patterns, what color! Amazing tunes, and so vibey! I'll be sure to tell the camp leads how delighted I am with it all.""

""We're pleased to hear that,"" the tricksters said. They proceeded to name all the activities they had planned, and to explain the intricate details of the VIP camping areas. The old wrangler paid the closest attention, so that she could tell it all to the camp leads. And so she did.

The tricksters at once asked for more budget, more expensive champagne and more silk and gold thread, to get on with the most amazing camp ever planned. But it all went into their pockets. Not an item got packed, and not a plan got planned.

The theme camp leads presently sent another trustworthy camp member to see how the work progressed and how soon it would be ready. The same thing happened to him that had happened to the wrangler. He looked and he looked, but as there was nothing to see, he saw nothing. 

""Isn't it a beautiful theme idea?"" the tricksters asked him, as they displayed and described their imaginary decor.

""I know I'm not stupid,"" the man thought, ""so it must be that I'm unworthy of Tankwa Town. That's strange. I mustn't let anyone find it out, though."" So he praised the layout he did not see. He declared he was delighted with the exciting activities and the exquisite performances and plans. To the theme camp leads he said, ""It held me spellbound.""

All the town was talking of this splendid campsite, and the camp leads wanted to see it for themselves while it was still being prepared. So the main camp comrades got together and went to go see the two tricksters creating the camp that would blow all the others out the dust. They found them planning with might and main, but without a word on a page.

""Magnificent,"" said the two campers already duped. ""Just look, guys, what cool effects! What a design!"" They pointed to the empty spreadsheets, each supposing that the others could see the stuff.

""What's this?"" thought each of the camp leads. ""I can't see anything. This is terrible! Am I a fool? Am I unfit to be a camp leader? What a thing to happen to me of all people! I have to be fit for Tankwa - Oh! It's very cool,"" they said in turn. ""It has our highest approval."" And they nodded approbation at the empty plans. Nothing could make either of them say that they couldn't see anything.

The whole team stared and stared. One saw no more than another, but they all joined the camp leads in exclaiming, ""Oh! It's very cool,"" and they joked and jostled about how great a time they would have with their exclusive parties and their fabulous outfits so shortly in the desert. ""Magnificent! Excellent! Unsurpassed!"" were bandied from mouth to mouth, and everyone did his or her best to seem well pleased. The camp leads gave each of the tricksters a medallion to wear around their necks, and made them honorary camp members for life.

The night before they left for the desert the tricksters sat up all night burning candles and sending out long emails. They flourished and flounced and made sure everyone knew how busy they were putting the final touches of the camp together. They threw tantrums and called people names, and planned plan after plan. And at last they said, ""Now the theme camp is ready!""

Then the leads themselves came with their most V of VIP guests, and the tricksters walked them around the empty yard, showing and pointing at nothing at all. They said, ""This is the communal Jacuzzi, and this is the chocolate fountain. This is the massage bar, and these are the stripper poles. Here's your luxury camper vans and your amazing super yacht mutant vehicle. Every single part of the camp is so slight and sexy, so carefully designed, but that's what makes them so fine.""

""Exactly,"" all the campers agreed, though they could see nothing, for there was nothing to see.

So they jumped in their cars, and they drove off into the dust, with the tricksters driving a massive-ass truck. They arrived at the site and they dived into works, pulling invisible levers and pushing invisible buttons. Giving loud orders and making a show of arranging an oasis in the centre of town. 

""My word, it's incredible. Oh gosh, how divine."" Every onlooker proclaimed how fantastic it was. Until the tricksters said, ""There you go, enjoy yourselves!"" And disappeared into the crowds. 

""Well, we're supposed to be ready,"" the campers said, and began to pretend to toast champagne and start their spit-braai.

The campers who were to man the bar began pouring drinks and handing them out. And the DJs in the team began spinning invisible vinyls. No one dared to admit that they had nothing to do. 

So on went the party with nothing to see, and VIP guests all pretended to be. They gifted non-gifts and they danced on imaginary dancfloors to silent musics.  Every single person was pretending to have a magnificent time. 

""But there's nothing there,"" a little burner child said.

""Did you ever hear such innocent prattle?"" said its father. And one person whispered to another what the child had said, ""There's nothing there. A child says there's nothing there.""

""But there's nothing there!"" the whole of Tankwa Town cried out at last.

The theme camp leads and their teammates shivered, for they suspected the townsfolk were right. But they thought, ""This show has to go on."" So they danced and served and partied more proudly than ever, as the DJs played music that wasn't there at all.","","In the middle of our grand city, there's a truly breathtaking theme camp. A new addition to the Tankwa landscape for the year of ""Play"", brimming with entertainment, and teeming with trickery. Open day and night, the delights you will find within our glimmering silken tents will tease your soul and open your eyes.

I love that.

Our camp for 2017 will be to shoot a similar video - I want Afrikaburn visitors to come past our camp, to find sunscreen to be put on.  While they are there we will be asking them for a line, dressed in their favourite outfit and with their most fun way to do this - out of the poem called: Trust me on the Sunscreen. 


Watch the Dr Seuss video, then read the Sunscreen poem, and imagine all the delightful costumes and people at Tankwa - creating a unique video with a fantastic message.

Once collected, from a few selectively placed cameras in and outside our camp, we'll be compiling a video after the 2017 Afrikaburn, and share the new African version of this video, for everyone to enjoy and share.

Our video crew is professional (as in good, not as in paid), and our editing world-class.

You'll get a production of note and delight.

Oh and as a side note-  it's my 50th and all people in the theme camp will be friends celebrating my half century with me.

Trust me on the Sunscreen:

Ladies and Gentleman, 
Wear sunscreen.
If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it.

The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience... 

I will dispense this advice now.

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth; oh nevermind; you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded.

But trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked... 

You're not as fat as you Imagine.

Don't worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum.

The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind.
The kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday.

Do one thing everyday that scares you.

Sing.

Don't be reckless with other people's hearts, don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.

Floss.

Don't waste your time on jealousy; 
Sometimes you're ahead, 

Sometimes You're behind.

The race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself.

Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults; 
If you Succeed in doing this, tell me how.

Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements.

Stretch.

Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your Life.
The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives, some of the most interesting 50 year olds I know still don't.

Get plenty of calcium.

Be kind to your knees, you'll miss them when they're gone.

Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't, maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't, maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary.

Whatever you do, don't Congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either.
Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's.

Enjoy your body, Use it every way you can... Don't be afraid of it, or what other people Think of it, 
It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own... 

Dance... even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room.

Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.

Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly.

Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good.

Be nice to your siblings; 
They are the best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.

Understand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you should hold on.

Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle because the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young.

Live in Johannesburg once, but leave before it makes you hard; 
Live in Durban once, but leave before it makes you soft.

Travel.

Accept certain inalienable truths, prices will rise, politicians will Philander, you too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.

Respect your elders.

Don't expect anyone else to support you.
Maybe you have a trust fund, Maybe you have a wealthy spouse; but you never know when either one might run out.

Don't mess too much with your hair, or by the time you're 40, it will look 85.

Be careful whose advice you buy, but, be patient with those who supply it. 

Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.

"4688","Lilly the Leviathan","","","Molly the mollusc (A.K.A psy the snail) took a well-deserved holiday after the previous Burn. She slimed herself all the way up the N7 to the sleepy seaside village, Langabaan. After a few days lounging on the beach and sipping klippies and coke, she became restless and decided to persue an activity. Being not particularly passionate about water sports she discovered that there was not much too do in Langabaan and was therefore left to vent out her excess energy by taking a long walk on the beach.

The sun was setting, the South Easter gently whistled past Molly’s antennae and the sea sung to her with its crumbling waves. However, she felt somewhat lonely, longing for someone to share this beautiful moment with her. Just as she was about to download tinder, the waves in front of her parted. Out from the depths emerged a creature, something Molly had never seen before, not even on some late night Discovery show. At first, Molly was scared. However, as this aquatic beast approached her, she could not help but be slightly swooned by its sparkling scales and virile dorsal fin.

Molly was not lonely for the last few days of her holiday. She had the summer romance any girl dreams of and biological processes that no biologist could have ever imagined. 

A few months after leaving Langabaan and returning to the daily grind she discovered that she had not only left that town with a whole bunch of ‘new eye-opening experiences’, she had forgotten to use protection and is pregnant.

The ultrasound relieved a strange creature. Something vaguely resembling a hybrid between a gastropod and a mythic deep ocean monster. It will light up at night, much like its mother but is far more stream line and locomotes itself on two wheels (while in the terrestrial biosphere). 

While gestation has been a roller coaster of emotions, Molly knows that her offspring is going to be a wild, mysterious and wonderful creature that will be loved by all.

As Lilly will still be young, so she will be a modest-sized monster, we will watch her grow in the next few years.

She will name her daughter, ‘Lilly the Leviathan’.

Leviathan (/lᵻˈvaɪ.əθən/; Hebrew: לִוְיָתָן, Modern Livyatan, Tiberian Liwyāṯān) is a big fish referenced in the Tanakh, or the Old Testament. This word has become synonymous with any large sea monster or creature.

If you see her around stop and say 'howzit my china'. Perhaps you’ll get a little more than you bargained for … Oooo. Naughty, naughty. 

Oh yeah baby. Oh yeah.

Long thought to be extinct, this the worlds largest butterfly has been recently spotted in the Karroo again. 

Here are six interesting facts about them:
1.	These beautiful butterflies are one of the largest in the world, with a wingspan of up to 300 cm.
2.	Their gossamer wings are a glowing bright blue with clear dots.  This helps them to hide when they sitting down or to confuse predators with a bright flashing patina when they are flying at night.
3.	They drink the juices from fruit by sucking it up a straw-like appendage. (They are particularly fond of cocktails.)
4.	They have been known to carry other species in a cocoon-like structure, which is attached to their abdomen. 
5.	The entire life cycle of a lesser Spotted Karroo Blue Morpho butterfly from egg to adult is just 4 days.
6.	The lesser Spotted Karroo Blue Morpho butterflies are solitary but occasionally interact with small groups of other true ""butterflies"" belonging to the ""Papilionburnus: superfamily. They can be found on the open plains of the Karroo, South Africa. They are mainly active at sunset and early evening.

I hope that you found these facts interesting and learned something new.
